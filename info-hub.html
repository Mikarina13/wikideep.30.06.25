      <p>This is your central place to find all the essential information about WikiDeep.io. Whether you're looking to understand our mission, how to contribute, our terms of use, privacy practices, how to support us, or how to get in touch, you'll find it all clearly laid out here. We believe in transparency and open communication, and this Hub is designed to provide you with everything you need to know about being a part of the WikiDeep.io community.</p>

      <h2 id="contributor-guidelines">Contributor Guidelines</h2>

      <h3>What to Share: Valuable "Deep Search" Results & Insights</h3>
      <p>• We're looking for in-depth answers, detailed explanations, research summaries, creative outputs, or complex problem-solving results that you've obtained from advanced AI models (like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Grok, etc.).<br>
      • Think of insights that took significant prompting, multiple interactions, or used the AI's "deep search" or extensive reasoning capabilities.<br>
      • If it helped you understand something complex or saved you a ton of research, it's likely valuable for others!</p>

      <h3>Aim for Quality & Clarity in Your Contribution:</h3>
      <p>• Accuracy: While AI can make mistakes, please review the insight for factual accuracy to the best of your ability. If the AI cited sources, double-check a few if you can.<br>
      • Completeness: Share the full, relevant output. Don't cut it short if the context is important.<br>
      • Clarity & Structure:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Ensure the insight is well-formatted (use Markdown for headings, lists, bolding, etc. in the submission form).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;• Break up long blocks of text for easier reading.<br>
      • Neutral Tone (Mostly): For factual or explanatory insights, aim for a neutral, objective tone (like Wikipedia). Creative pieces can, of course, have their own style.</p>

      <h3>Provide Good Metadata (The More, The Better!):</h3>
      <p>• AI Model Used: Be specific (e.g., "GPT-4 Turbo," "Claude 3 Opus," "Gemini 1.5 Pro").<br>
      • Original Prompt(s): Sharing your main prompt(s) is highly encouraged! This helps others learn prompt engineering and understand the context of the AI's output. For the MVP, shared prompts will be visible with the insight. (Future plans include ways for you to monetize access to your prompts!).<br>
      • Relevant Tags: Add 3-5 relevant topic tags (e.g., "AI ethics," "quantum computing," "Next.js development," "climate change solutions"). This helps others find your insight.<br>
      • Sources/References (If Applicable): If the AI's output was based on or cited specific external sources, please include those URLs or references.<br>
      • Optional Details: Tier Tag (basic, analytical, speculative, etc.), generation date, your estimate of AI compute cost (Wh).</p>

      <h3>Content You MUST AVOID Sharing:</h3>
      <p>• Copyright Infringement: Do not submit content that infringes on someone else's copyright. You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to share any material you post, including AI-generated outputs (most AI tools grant you rights to the output, but be mindful).<br>
      • Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Do not share private, sensitive personal information about yourself or others without explicit consent.<br>
      • Hate Speech, Harassment, Defamatory Content: Absolutely no content that is hateful, discriminatory, harassing, threatening, or defamatory.<br>
      • Misinformation/Disinformation: Do not knowingly submit false or misleading information with the intent to deceive. While AI can err, deliberate disinformation is not welcome.<br>
      • Illegal Content: Anything that violates applicable laws.<br>
      • Spam or Purely Promotional Content: DeepWiki is for sharing knowledge, not for unsolicited advertising.</p>

      <h3>Your Responsibilities & Rights as a Contributor:</h3>
      <p>• You Own Your Contribution (and Responsibility!): You are solely responsible for the insights you submit.<br>
      • You Affirm Your Rights: By submitting, you confirm that you have all necessary rights to share the content and that it doesn't violate any third-party rights.<br>
      • CC BY-SA 4.0 License: To ensure insights can be freely shared and built upon, you agree to license all your contributions to WikiDeep.io under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.<br>
      • Attribution: Your chosen Contributor Alias will be displayed with your insights.</p>

      <h3>Community Interaction (Keep it Positive!):</h3>
      <p>• (Future features may include comments or discussions). For now, let's build a respectful foundation.<br>
      • Help us make WikiDeep a great place for learning and sharing.</p>

      <h3>Moderation & Our Role:</h3>
      <p>• WikiDeep.io is a platform that hosts community-shared content. We (the WikiDeep team) will do our best to ensure a positive environment.<br>
      • Submissions may be reviewed (initially by the team, potentially with AI assistance like Google's Perspective API, and later by community moderators).<br>
      • We reserve the right to remove content that violates these guidelines or our Terms of Use, or to change the status of a submission.<br>
      • We aim for transparency in our moderation processes.</p>
